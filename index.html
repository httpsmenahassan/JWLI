            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>JWLI (Japanese Women's Leadership Initiative) is a program that was founded in 2006 with the aim of
                empowering Japanese women to become leaders in their respective fields. The program was started by
                Atsuko Fish, who is a Japanese American philanthropist and founder of the Fish Family Foundation.


                JWLI offers a six-month training program in the United States for Japanese women who are already leaders
                or have the potential to become leaders in their fields. The program focuses on leadership development,
                networking, and skill-building through a combination of classroom instruction, site visits, and
                mentorship.

                <br>

                Since its inception, JWLI has trained over 100 Japanese women from diverse fields, including business,
                education, politics, and the nonprofit sector. The program has also expanded its reach beyond the
                six-month training program to include ongoing support for alumni, including access to mentors,
                networking opportunities, and resources to support their continued growth and success.

                <br>

                JWLI's mission is to inspire and empower Japanese women to become leaders who will make a positive
                impact in their communities and beyond. The organization's work is part of a broader movement to
                increase gender equality and diversity in leadership positions in Japan and around the world.

                <h4>Atsuko Toko Fish - Founder</h4>
                <p>Atsuko Toko Fish is a remarkable entrepreneur and philanthropist who has dedicated her life to
                    promoting cross-cultural understanding and empowering women through education and entrepreneurship.
                    Born in Japan, Fish moved to the United States in the early 1980s and quickly established herself as
                    a successful businesswoman, founding her own company and building it into a thriving enterprise.</p>

                <p>However, Fish's passion for social justice and her desire to give back to her community soon led her
                    to shift her focus towards philanthropy. In 1996, she founded the Atsuko Toko Fish Foundation, which
                    aims to empower women through education and support. The foundation provides scholarships and
                    mentoring to women pursuing higher education in the United States and Japan, and also supports women
                    entrepreneurs through business training and funding.</p>

                <p>Fish's tireless efforts to promote cross-cultural understanding have earned her numerous awards and
                    accolades, including being named one of the "100 Most Powerful Women in Washington" by Washingtonian
                    magazine. Through her foundation, she has helped countless women achieve their dreams and break down
                    barriers to success, leaving a lasting impact on the world around her.
